## 🔹 Brief Description of the Solution

AI-Powered Campus Lost & Found is a web-based platform designed to improve the recovery of lost items on campus.  
Students can report lost or found items by uploading an image and a short description. The system uses **multimodal AI** to intelligently match found items with lost-item reports and notifies users when a potential match is detected, along with an AI-generated explanation of why the match was made.

This removes the dependency on manual searching, WhatsApp groups, or human memory, and replaces it with an automated, transparent, and scalable solution built using Google technologies.
